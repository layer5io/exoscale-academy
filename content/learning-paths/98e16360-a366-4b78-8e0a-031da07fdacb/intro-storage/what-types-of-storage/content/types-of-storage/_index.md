### Definition
When it comes to storage in the cloud, there are three main types:

- File Storage
- Object Storage
- Block Storage

Each type has its unique characteristics and use cases:

| Type           | Use Case                                                  |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| File Storage   | Suitable for structured file-based data                  |
| Object Storage | Ideal for unstructured data and cloud-native applications |
| Block Storage  | Provides low-level access for high-performance applications |

The choice between these storage types depends on your specific requirements and the nature of the data you need to store in the cloud.

Let's take a closer look at each of them.

### Files Storage

File storage is designed to store and manage files in a hierarchical structure, similar to how files are organized in a traditional file system. It provides a shared file system that can be accessed by multiple users or applications simultaneously. File storage is suitable for scenarios where you need to store and access files in a structured manner, such as shared drives, file sharing, or hosting web content.
### Object Storage

Object storage, on the other hand, is a storage architecture that manages data as objects. Each object consists of data, metadata (attributes or properties associated with the object), and a unique identifier. Object storage is highly scalable and offers virtually unlimited storage capacity. It is ideal for storing unstructured data like images, videos, documents, backups, and logs. Object storage is accessed using APIs, making it suitable for cloud-native applications and distributed systems.
### Block Storage

Block storage works at the lowest storage level. It provides raw storage volumes that can be mounted as block devices by virtual machines or servers. It offers high-performance storage with low latency and is often used for databases, virtual machines, and applications that require direct access to storage at the block level. The operating system manages block storage and requires a file system to organize and manage data.
