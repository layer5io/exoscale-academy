### Definition

Storage is crucial for preserving and accessing computer data, files, applications, and other digital content. Storage refers to the process of storing and retrieving data or information. It is an essential component of any computer system.

### Basic Storage Types

There are several basic types of storage that are commonly used in computing systems. Here are the most common types:

#### Primary Storage

It is volatile, meaning its contents are lost when the computer is powered off or restarted. The computer's immediate storage space that holds processed data is also known as main memory or RAM (Random Access Memory). Primary storage is much faster than secondary storage but has limited capacity and is more expensive.
#### Secondary Storage

It is non-volatile and long-term storage for data and programs, meaning it retains data even when the power is turned off. It includes devices such as hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), optical discs (CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray), USB flash drives, and network-attached storage (NAS) devices. Secondary storage is slower than primary storage but offers much larger storage capacities at a lower cost.
#### Tertiary Storage

Tertiary storage is used for archival purposes and is typically slower and less accessible than primary and secondary storage. Examples include magnetic tape drives and optical jukeboxes.
### Usage Storage Types

There are several usage types of storage that are commonly used in computing systems. Here are the most common types:
#### Offline Storage

Offline storage refers to storage devices that are not constantly connected to the computer system. Examples include external hard drives, USB flash drives, and memory cards.
#### Network Storage

This type of storage is accessed over a network and is shared among multiple computers. Network-Attached Storage (NAS) and Storage Area Networks (SAN) are common examples of network storage.
#### Virtual Storage

Virtual storage is a technique that allows the operating system to use secondary storage as if it were primary storage. It uses techniques like paging and swapping to manage memory efficiently.
### Cloud Storage Types

Cloud storage refers to storing data on remote servers accessed over the internet. It offers scalability, accessibility, and data redundancy. Cloud storage is catagorized into:
#### Ephemeral Storage

Ephemeral storage refers to temporary storage that is only available for the duration of a session or a specific task. Once the session or task ends, the data stored in ephemeral storage is typically erased or lost. Examples of ephemeral storage include RAM (Random Access Memory) and cache memory.

Ephemeral storage is often associated with cloud computing platforms, where virtual machines or containers are provisioned with temporary storage that is attached to the instance during its runtime. This storage is typically local to the instance and is not shared with other instances or persisted when the instance is terminated or restarted.

Ephemeral storage is commonly used for temporary files, caches, logs, or any other data that is only needed temporarily and can be easily recreated or regenerated if lost. It is not suitable for storing important or permanent data, as it is not designed for durability or long-term persistence.
#### Persistent Storage

Persistent storage is designed to retain data even when the power is turned off or the session ends. It is used for long-term storage of data that needs to be preserved and accessed across multiple sessions. Examples of persistent storage include hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), optical drives, and cloud storage services.

Persistent storage is typically provided by external storage systems such as hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), network-attached storage (NAS), storage area networks (SAN), or cloud-based object storage services. These storage systems are designed to ensure data durability and availability, even in the face of hardware failures or other disruptions.

Persistent storage is typically slower than ephemeral storage, as it often involves accessing data over a network or from disk-based storage devices. However, it provides the advantage of durability and the ability to retain data even in the event of system failures or restarts.
### Ephemeral vs Persistent

The distinction between ephemeral storage and persistent storage lies in the duration of data retention. Ephemeral storage is temporary and volatile, while persistent storage is permanent and non-volatile. The categories for ephemeral storage and persistent storage are as follows:

Unlike ephemeral storage, which is temporary and local to a computing instance, persistent storage is designed to retain data over extended periods of time. It is commonly used for storing critical application data, databases, user files, configuration files, and other important information that needs to be preserved and accessed across multiple instances or sessions.

In contrast to ephemeral storage, persistent storage is designed for long-term data storage and is typically provided by external storage systems such as network-attached storage (NAS), storage area networks (SAN), or cloud-based object storage services. Persistent storage is durable and can survive system restarts or failures, ensuring that data is not lost.

### Storage Tier

A storage tier refers to a specific level or category of storage within a storage system. It is used to classify and organize data based on its performance, availability, and cost characteristics. Storage tiers are typically defined based on the underlying technology, such as solid-state drives (SSD), hard disk drives (HDD), or tape drives.

Storage tiers provide a way to categorize and manage data based on its characteristics, allowing organizations to optimize storage resources and meet the specific needs of different types of data.
#### Storage Performance

The purpose of implementing storage tiers is to optimize the utilization of storage resources and match the requirements of different types of data. By assigning data to appropriate storage tiers, organizations can ensure that frequently accessed or critical data is stored on high-performance storage media, while less frequently accessed or less critical data is stored on lower-cost storage media.
### Storage Management

Storage tiers are often associated with hierarchical storage management (HSM) systems or storage virtualization technologies. These systems automatically move data between different tiers based on predefined policies and data access patterns. This dynamic data movement helps to balance performance, cost, and capacity requirements.

### Storage Type vs Storage Tier

The terms storage type and storage tier are related but have different meanings in the context of storage systems. Here's a breakdown of the differences:
#### Storage Type

A storage type refers to the underlying technology or medium used for storing data. It describes the physical or logical storage device or system. For example, common storage types include solid-state drives (SSD), hard disk drives (HDD), tape drives, or cloud storage. Each storage type has its own characteristics in terms of performance, capacity, cost, and durability.
#### Storage Tier

A storage tier, on the other hand, refers to a specific level or category within a storage system that is based on performance, availability, and cost. It is a way of organizing and classifying data based on its importance or access patterns. Storage tiers are typically defined within a storage system and can consist of one or more storage types.

In other words, a storage tier is a logical grouping or classification of data based on its characteristics, while a storage type refers to the actual technology or medium used for storing the data.

Storage tiers are often implemented within storage systems to optimize data placement and resource utilization. By assigning data to appropriate storage tiers, organizations can ensure that data is stored on the most suitable storage types based on its importance, performance requirements, and cost considerations. This allows for efficient data management and cost-effective storage solutions.
