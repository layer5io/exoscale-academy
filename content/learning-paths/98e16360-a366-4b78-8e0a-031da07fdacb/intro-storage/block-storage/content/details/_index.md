### Explained

Block storage is a fundamental component of cloud computing infrastructure, offering a versatile and scalable solution for storing and managing data. It allows dividing data into fixed-sized blocks, which can be accessed and manipulated independently. This flexibility allows for efficient data storage and retrieval, making block storage an ideal choice for applications requiring high-performance storage, such as databases and virtual machines. By leveraging block storage, organizations can focus on their core workflows and applications without the burden of managing file storage and locations. With the ability to scale horizontally and integrate seamlessly with other cloud services, block storage empowers customers to overcome the limitations of legacy storage systems, ensuring optimal performance and cost-effectiveness at any scale.

### Definition

Block storage is an architecture that divides data into fixed-size blocks, each with a unique address. Block storage devices like hard disk and solid-state drives use block-level access protocols like iSCSI and Fibre Channel to read and write data. This storage method is ideal for low-latency, high-performance environments where data access speed is crucial. However, it can be more complex and expensive to set up initially.

Critical characteristics of block storage include:

- Block-level data access: Block storage systems provide direct access to the underlying storage blocks, allowing high-speed data reads and writes. This low-latency access is particularly beneficial for applications requiring rapid data access, such as databases and virtual machines.
- File system abstraction: Block storage devices present a file system abstraction to the host operating system, meaning they appear as a traditional file system to the user. This abstraction allows users and applications to interact with the storage device using familiar file and directory structures, simplifying data storage and retrieval.
- Data consistency: Block storage systems employ data consistency techniques, such as journaling and copy-on-write, to ensure that data remains consistent and accurate. These techniques help to prevent data corruption and loss, making block storage a reliable option for critical data storage requirements. Now that we've explained the basic capabilities of object and block storage, let's see how they go head-to-head.
