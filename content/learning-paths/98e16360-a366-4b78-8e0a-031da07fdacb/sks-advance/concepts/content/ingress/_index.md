### Ingress

We already know the LoadBalancer service in Kubernetes from the SKS starter course. However, LoadBalancer works only on network layer 4; it can not distinguish between different hostnames and paths and cannot terminate SSL traffic. These additional capabilities are provided in Kubernetes by the Ingress service.

The Ingress uses a reverse proxy, like Nginx, to handle network layer 7 balancing in the Kubernetes cluster and the often needed additional, multiple routing paths. If there are advanced routing demands, the Ingress service can provide and handle them.
