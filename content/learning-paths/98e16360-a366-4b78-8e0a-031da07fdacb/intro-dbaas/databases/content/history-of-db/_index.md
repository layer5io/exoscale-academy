**Part 2** of the History of Database Evolution is about the influence of new technologies and the emergence of new players with new clever ideas (new database models). Today is all about combining, improving, optimizing, and automizing all available database models and their respective implementations (closed source and open source). The future is focused on driving business innovations with specialized database models specifically built/developed for business requirements.

Unfortunately, the article is not available anymore, but the graphic survived on the internet. It gives an excellent summary of the past and predicts the future, as seen in 2016.
