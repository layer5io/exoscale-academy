### Explained

![cont-delivery](cont-delivery.png)

Continuous Delivery is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to production safely and reliably, with minimal human intervention.

It aims to deliver software updates frequently and consistently, allowing organizations to respond quickly to changing market needs and customer feedback.

Continuous Delivery is a powerful approach to software development that can help businesses achieve greater agility, efficiency, and quality in their software delivery process. By automating the build, test, and deployment process, developers can focus on writing code and delivering new features rather than spending time on manual processes. Additionally, Continuous Delivery can help to improve software quality by catching errors and bugs early in the development process before they can cause problems in production. However, there are also some potential challenges to implementing Continuous Delivery.

For example, it can require significant investment in tools, infrastructure, and training to implement effectively. Additionally, Continuous Delivery can introduce additional complexity and risk, mainly when working with microservices or distributed systems. Despite these challenges, Continuous Delivery is becoming increasingly popular in modern software development, allowing businesses to deliver software faster and more reliably while improving quality and reducing costs.
