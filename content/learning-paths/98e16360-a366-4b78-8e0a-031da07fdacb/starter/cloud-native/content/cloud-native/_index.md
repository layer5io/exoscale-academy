### Explained

Cloud-native refers to a software development approach that leverages cloud computing services and infrastructure to build and deploy applications. It involves designing applications as a collection of microservices that can run independently and scale dynamically, using containerization and orchestration technologies like Kubernetes.

Cloud-native applications are built to be resilient, scalable, and highly available and are often deployed using automated continuous delivery pipelines.

### Why Cloud-Native?
**Scalability**: Cloud-native applications are designed to scale dynamically, allowing organizations to handle increased traffic and demand without downtime or performance issues.

**Agility**: Cloud-native applications can be developed, tested, and deployed quickly, allowing organizations to respond rapidly to changing market needs and customer feedback.

**Resilience**: Cloud-native applications are designed to be fault-tolerant and resilient, with built-in redundancy and failover mechanisms that minimize downtime and data loss.

**Flexibility**: Cloud-native applications are designed to run on multiple cloud platforms and environments, allowing organizations to choose the best option for their needs and avoid vendor lock-in.

**Cost-efficiency**: Cloud-native applications can be deployed and scaled automatically, reducing the need for manual intervention and minimizing operational costs.

Overall, cloud-native is essential because it enables organizations to deliver software faster, with higher quality and reliability, while reducing costs and increasing agility.
