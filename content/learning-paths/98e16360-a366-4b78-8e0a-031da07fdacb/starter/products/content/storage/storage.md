### Object Storage
Exoscale's Simple Object Storage (SOS) is a scalable and cost-effective solution for storing and managing large amounts of data. It offers highly available multi-redundancy storage, ensuring data safety and accessibility. You can store various files and objects, such as assets, backups, and media files. Your data remains in the exact location you store it, and Exoscale replicates it in at least three physical copies for maximum safety.

**Features Overview:**

- S3 compatible
- Direct HTTP/S access
- Metadata support
- ACL and CORS support
- For any data
- Pay for what you use
- Free inbound traffic

The S3-compatible API allows for easy integration with existing workflows and applications. SOS provides low latency, high bandwidth, and secure HTTP(s) access, allowing fast and secure data management from any location. You can enhance this with Exoscale's CDN integration.
