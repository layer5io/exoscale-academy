### IaaS+

Infrastructure as a Service is the cloud service model we support with the Exoscale platform and a bit more, hence, IaaS+.

### Platform

A state-of-the-art IaaS platform providing the building blocks for your application infrastructure.

The following questions arise if you think about the breadth of the cloud offerings in the market today:

- Why IaaS?
- Who uses IaaS?
- Why Exoscale?


#### Why IaaS?

It is the cloud computing model to extend or replace your data center.

Let's look at the trends of the worldwide IT infrastructure market.

![IDC](IDC.png)

The IDC figures show clearly that the infrastructure game is changing. Even though there are still markets where cloud adoption is low and slow, there is a clear trend that the public cloud will be a significant part of IT infrastructure.

**By 2028:**
- **private cloud** (cloud & dedicated) share **will grow** from 15.7% **to 16.9%**
- **public cloud** (cloud & shared) part will be **up** from 49.0% to **58.1%**
- **on-premises** part (non-cloud & dedicated) will be **down** from 35.3% **to 25.0%**

#### Who uses IaaS?
IaaS users, in general, are looking for TWO significant benefits:

- **MORE DYNAMIC**, servers can be started and stopped as needed without the up-front cost.
- **REDUCED COMPLEXITY**, of buying, repairing, or dealing with physical hardware.
