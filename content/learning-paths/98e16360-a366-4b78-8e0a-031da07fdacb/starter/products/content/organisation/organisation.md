### Billing Info
**Billing Details**

It is not currently possible to modify the country associated with your organization. Please contact support if you need assistance. It is not currently possible to modify your organization's VAT number.

**Credit Threshold**
You will receive an email notification when your credit balance drops below the specified threshold, set by default to 15 CHF/EUR/UDS. To avoid service disruptions, top up your balance regularly according to your consumption needs.

**Usage Overview & Detail**
Usage Overview: outlines your consumption for a specific time frame and your current billing mode. If your billing mode is set to Post-Paid, you will receive an invoice based on your monthly consumption, and your default credit card will be charged for the due amount.
