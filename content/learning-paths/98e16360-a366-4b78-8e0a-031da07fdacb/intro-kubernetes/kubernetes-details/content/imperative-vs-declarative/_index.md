### **Configuration Differences**

What a difference a configuration make :).

The significant change in this new IT world is that well-trained and practiced processes are outdated and useless. The imperative was the old world, you defined step-by-step guidance, and you also executed or overseen the execution of those configuration steps. The declarative way is to determine the desired state and an intelligent system conducts and supervises the configuration and operation steps.
