It is your cluster on your terms. Size the Node-Pools as needed, using all instance types available. Attach one Node-Pool with Memory-Optimized instances and another one with CPU-Optimized ones.

Kubernetes is a fast-changing platform, and versions roll out fast. SKS has built-in commands to upgrade your control plane seamlessly â€“ minimizing downtimes and errors.

**Integration with NLB and Instance Pools**

Manage ingress traffic with Exoscale Network Load Balancer support directly integrated into SKS management. Scale pools from Kubernetes using Instance Pools.

**High-Availability control plane**
With the PRO SKS plan, benefit from a resilient HA Kubernetes control plane, so your workloads are always up.

**Simple and transparent pricing**

With a free STARTER version and an affordable PRO plan, SKS provides straightforward pricing. Nodes are charged their usual rate with no extra cluster management fee.
