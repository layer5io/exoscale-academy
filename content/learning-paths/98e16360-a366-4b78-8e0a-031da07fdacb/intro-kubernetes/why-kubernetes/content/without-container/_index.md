### Why Kubernetes?

Running services in containers tend to produce numerous containers pretty quick. Handling many containers with no additional aid is a very cumbersome job. Hence, an orchestration solution is necessary to run services in containers efficiently.

### Without Container Orchestration

- Think about scaling up services; it **increases manual work**.
- Think about fixing crashing nodes; it **increases manual work**.
- Think about the complexity of running new stuff in production; it **increases**.
- Think about the human cost of running those services; it **increases**.
- Scaling services/applications becomes more and more **difficult**.
- Public cloud provider resource usage becomes more and more **expensive**.
