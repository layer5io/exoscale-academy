### Container Orchestration Ecosystem

While Kubernetes solves the orchestration part, additional components are needed to deploy and run containers smoothly in production.

Container lifecycle management as well as monitoring, backup, CI/CD, security, logging and registration are all activities needed in container orchestration.

K8s comes with multiple options and plugins for each layer. Each team has its preferences for ecosystem decisions.
